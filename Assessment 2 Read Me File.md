The design for this second assignment remained the same as the first but little features such as the login box, sign up box e.t.c were introduced. 
The colours remained same and the entire design wasn't changed as same colours were used for the navbar, footer e.t.c
The use of Bootstrap 3 was also used to enhance the responsiveness of the items in this assignment.
