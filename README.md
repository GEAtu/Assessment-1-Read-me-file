Home Page: This is the page that first loads up when a user enters the website. It contains a navigation bar, two videos including a HTML5 video and an Iframe Youtube embed. It also has paragraphs that tells the user more about the page. It has a sticky footer which stays at the bottom of the website. It has two navigation links(Home and Products). The Home link takes you to the current page or rather reloads the page while the products page takes you to the products section containing all the items to purchase. This page is very well responsive to all media screens including phones,tablets,ipads and ipods.

It has a sub navigation bar beneath the main that holds the shopping cart and has a cart icon that can be accessed anytime on the page. It displays a pop-up notifying the user that the an item has been added to the cart once the "Add To Cart" button has been pressed on the item to be purchased. It contains all products ranging from T-Shirts, Hoodies aswell as Jumpers.


Cart Page: This is the page that is accessed once the user wants to view items which has been selected and added to the cart. This page will contain either T-shirts, hoodies or jumpers which have been selected by the user. It will contain the serial number of the item, the amount of items the user has purchased, and the price of the item aswell. The cart page has been linked to the cart icon found in the products page and can only be accessed in the products page. This is to make things easier and more efficient/accessible for users.

The design for this second assignment remained the same as the first but little features such as the login box, sign up box e.t.c were introduced. 
The colours remained same and the entire design wasn't changed as same colours were used for the navbar, footer e.t.c
The use of Bootstrap 3 was also used to enhance the responsiveness of the items in this assignment.
